# EntreeChoiceMatcher
This project matches a beverage with a person's entree choice using code developed in the Dinner Entree Receipt project.

Here is a description of the specs for the project:

Convert the receipt project from the Dinner Entree Receipt project to use a function called

select_beverage($dinner)

The function should use the entree chosen through your HTML form, passing it into the function by the $dinner parameter, and the result, the drink chosen within the function, should be returned to your program to be processed with the rest of the receipt. Comment your code.
